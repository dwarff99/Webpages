        <p>Mumbai is known to be the city that never sleeps; its vibe is pulsating in its cosmopolitan nature and it’s always craving for more space for its burgeoning population. Luckily for us, exotic Dutch dancer Mata Hari has come to town in all her grandeur and opulence, changing the way we party.<br>
        
        For long now the city has been missing a night spot that exudes the charm of a long forgotten era. Matahaari is a tribute to the iconic past of a courtesan and secret agent, as well as a giant leap forward into the 21st century of entertainment.<br>
        
        This grand 7,500 sq feet nightclub housed in Atria Mall, Worli is the city’s hottest and newest party destination.</p>
